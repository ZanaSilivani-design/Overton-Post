            School has finished their 2-year renovation that made the school bigger and easier to maneuver around the school.
            The cafeteria and the library changed their locations to the back of the school, they are bigger and more suited
            for many students, along with the bus drop. The big gym is still located where it normally was, but they updated
            the floor, the seats, and the basketball hoops. All of this supports comprehensive programs designed to develop
            graduates who are ready for college, careers and life. <br> <br> Our students gain more of an edge on studies,
            and technical studies. While developing thinking skills required for success in completing Tennessee’s rigorous
            diploma project requirements. We appoint students to classes that are appropriate to their standards. We also
            put students in classes that they could handle with teacher’s recommendations. Native speakers have the opportunity
            to learn the English language to prepare themselves for the ACT/SAT’s and life outside of school. During high
            school, students receive opportunities to work with our partners so they can gain experience to the real labor
            world as part of our Nationally Accredited Career Academy programs including; Information Technology, Engineering,
            Health Science, Music Performance and Event Marketing. Students will learn many things from the academic path
            they chose that can prepare them to the real labor world. <br> <br> As a Cambridge school, John Overton High
            offers opportunities for students to learn the global standard for international education and earned college
            credit. Along with: AP, Dual Enrollment and Vanderbilt Science, advanced academics abounds. At JOHS, most classes
            in our school have access to technology and online resources that will support our students. For now, our comprehensive
            athletics programs, powerful performing arts offerings, and extensive after-school activities and clubs help
            students know what they want to do in the future.</p>
